This app is still in development.

It's goal is to display the players stats for casters and for viewers of tournaments.

It's an overwolf app, which will be available on their store once it's ready :)

Updates (04/02/2023) :
Currently, we investigted two ways of getting the information from the game, by memory reading from overwolf, and from internal & official Riot apis. However those two don't provide the necessary informations that we need. Last resort we have is to implement a real time image to text recognition system to examine what is happening in game.
If you want to give us a hand on that, feel free to contact me on the Riot Games Third Party Developer Discord Community server : https://discord.com/invite/riotgamesdevrel, @Moussmous
